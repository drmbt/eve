description: Generate an image from text quickly with Flux Schnell.
tip: |-
  Flux is a text to image model that excels at prompt coherence and text generation. This should always be the default way to generate an image from text!

    tip: |-
      Flux loves very detailed and descriptive prompts so try to be elaborate. Flux is also great at drawing text in images so feel free to add something if it makes sense.

      This is the number of tries to generate for the prompt. If you get a request for n_samples > 1, you are still using a *single* prompt for the whole set.
