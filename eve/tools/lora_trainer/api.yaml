name: LoRA trainer
description: Finetune a model on top of base Stable Diffusion
tip: |-
  This will create a LoRA model from a base Stable Diffusion which captures and integrates the style, human face, or object represented in the training data.

    tip: |-
      Almost always, we want to train and SDXL LoRa. Only when we want to make animatediff animations do we need an sd15 lora.
    choices: [sdxl, sd15]
    default: sdxl
  max_train_steps:
    type: integer
    label: Training steps
    description: |-
      Number of training steps. Only increase this if you have lots of images (>50) otherwise the model wil overfit and will not look good.
    tip: |-
      This should be left at the default 300 when SDXL is the base model, unless the user *specifically* instructs you otherwise. If the base model is SD15, then you should *change* this to 800, again unless the user specifically requests something else.
    default: 300
    minimum: 100
    maximum: 1200
    step: 10
  resolution:
    type: integer
    label: Resolution
    description: |-
      Resolution your images will be resized to for training (512 is great and your generations will still look perfect when rendering at eg 1024)
    tip: |-
      Do not change this unless you are specifically instructed to. Highly recommended to train at 512 for optimal speed and at 768 for best quality.
    default: 512
    minimum: 512
    maximum: 768

    tip: |-
      You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!
