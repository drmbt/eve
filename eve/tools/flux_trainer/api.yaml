name: Flux LoRA trainer
description: Finetune a model on top of Flux-dev
tip: |-
  This will create a LoRA model from a base Flux-dev which captures and integrates the style, human face, or object represented in the training data.

    choices: [auto, face, object, style]
    default: auto
  max_train_steps:
    type: integer
    label: Training steps
    description: |-
      Number of training steps. Only increase this if you have lots of images (>50) otherwise the model wil overfit and will not look good.
    default: 3000
    minimum: 50
    maximum: 5000
    step: 10
  lora_rank:
    type: integer
    label: Rank
    description: |-
      LoRA rank. Higher gives model more capacity to learn but might lead to overfitting.
    default: 8
    minimum: 2
    maximum: 32
    step: 1
  learning_rate:
    type: float
    label: Learning rate
    description: |-
      Learning rate for training. Higher values converge faster but too high might cause overfitting. Low values are more accurate but slower.
    default: 0.5e-04
    minimum: 0.1e-04
    maximum: 2.0e-04
    step: 1.0e-05

    tip: |-
      You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!
