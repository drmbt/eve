name: Flux LoRA trainer
description: Finetune a model on top of Flux-dev
tip: |-
  This will create a LoRA model from a base Flux-dev which captures and integrates the style, human face, or object represented in the training data.

  max_train_steps:
    type: int
    label: Training steps
    description: |-
      Number of training steps. Only increase this if you have lots of images (>50) otherwise the model wil overfit and will not look good.
    default: 2000
    minimum: 500
    maximum: 5000
    step: 10
  lora_rank:
    type: int
    label: Rank
    description: |-
      LoRA rank. Higher gives model more capacity to learn but might lead to overfitting.
    default: 16
    minimum: 4
    maximum: 64
    step: 1
  learning_rate:
    type: float
    label: Learning rate
    description: |-
      Learning rate for training. Higher values converge faster but too high might cause overfitting. Low values are more accurate but slower.
    default: 0.0003
    minimum: 1.0e-05
    maximum: 0.001
    step: 1.0e-05
  learning_rate_decay:
    type: float
    label: Learning rate decay
    description: |-
      Learning rate decay for training. Higher values decay faster but too high might cause overfitting. Low values are more accurate but slower.
    default: 0.0001
    minimum: 1.0e-05
    maximum: 0.001

    tip: |-
      You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!
