description: Finetune a model on top of base Stable Diffusion
tip: This will create a LoRA model from a base Stable Diffusion which captures and integrates the style, human face, or object represented in the training data.

  tip: This should be left at the default 400 when SDXL is the base model, unless the user *specifically* instructs you otherwise. If the base model is SD1.5, then you should *change* this to 900, again unless the user specifically requests something else.
