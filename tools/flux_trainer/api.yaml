name: Flux LoRA trainer
description: Finetune a model on top of Flux-dev
tip: This will create a LoRA model from a base Flux-dev which captures and integrates the style, human face, or object represented in the training data.

  min_length: 1
- name: max_train_steps
  label: Training steps
  description: Number of training steps. Only increase this if you have lots of images (>50) otherwise the model wil overfit and will not look good.

- name: lora_rank
  label: Rank
  description: LoRA rank. Higher gives model more capacity to learn but might lead to overfitting.

  minimum: 4
  maximum: 64
  step: 1
- name: learning_rate
  label: Learning rate
  description: Learning rate for training. Higher values converge faster but too high might cause overfitting. Low values are more accurate but slower.

- name: seed
  label: Seed
  description: Set random seed for reproducibility. If blank, will be set to a random value.
  tip: You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!
