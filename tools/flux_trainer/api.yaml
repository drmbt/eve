name: Flux LoRA trainer
description: Finetune a model on top of Flux-dev
tip: This will create a LoRA model from a base Flux-dev which captures and integrates the style, human face, or object represented in the training data.
cost_estimate: 0.5 * max_train_steps
handler: gcp
parameters:
- name: name
  label: Name
  description: Name of the LoRA
  type: string
  required: true
- name: lora_training_urls
  label: Images
  description: Images to train LoRA with
  type: image[]
  required: true
  min_length: 1
- name: max_train_steps
  label: Training steps
  description: Number of training steps. Only increase this if you have lots of images (>50) otherwise the model wil overfit and will not look good.

  default: 500
  minimum: 100
  maximum: 1200

- name: lora_rank
  label: Rank
  description: LoRA rank. Higher gives model more capacity to learn but might lead to overfitting.
  type: int
  default: 16
  minimum: 8
  maximum: 64
  step: 1
- name: learning_rate
  label: Learning rate
  description: Learning rate for training. Higher values converge faster but too high might cause overfitting. Low values are more accurate but slower.
